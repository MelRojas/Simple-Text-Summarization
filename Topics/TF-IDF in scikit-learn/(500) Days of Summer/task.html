<p>Tom wants to know whether the word <code class="language-python">Summer</code> is important for the collection of texts and what kind of context surrounds this term. As you know, <code class="language-python">summer</code> can be both a capitalized proper noun (like, for example, someone's last name) and a lowercase common noun (which denotes a class of entities).</p>
<p>Correct the code below, so that the vectorizer could be case-sensitive and could extract bigrams (two-word phrases) and trigrams (three-word phrases). Put the final version of this vectorizer in the answer box. Do not remove any parameters, just copy the code below and correct the values where needed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(input='content', use_idf=True, lowercase=True,
                             analyzer='word', ngram_range=(1, 1),
                             stop_words=None)</code></pre>
